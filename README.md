# Leaked Conti manuals analysis

My personal analysis of leaked Conti "pentest" manuals mapped to MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise with [AtomicRedTeam tests](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and [Sigma rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) coverage mapped.

The original leak can be found on [VX-Undergrounds](vx-underground.org). Some files there violate Github ToS, if you want to browse just the text manuals visit [ForbiddenProgrammer/conti-pentester-guide-leak](https://github.com/ForbiddenProgrammer/conti-pentester-guide-leak)
